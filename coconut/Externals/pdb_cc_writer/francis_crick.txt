		p0 = pitch of larger helix
		alpha = 1/2 of helix crossing angle
		r0 = radius of larger helix; 5.1 for dimer, 
				6.3 for trimer. 6.8 for tetramer, 
				8.6 for pentamer, 9.1 for hexamer
		r1 = radius of smaller helix; 2.1 for helices
		h  = axial rise per amino acids 1.495 for polyalanine
		p  = periodicity of hydrophobic residues. 3.5 for canonical coiled-coils
		Interface angle = 2 * alpha => Interface angle between two helices, alpha=12 for 2-helix
		
		w0 = angle between two residues projected on x-y plane for major helix axis
		w1 = angle between two residues projected on x-y plane for minor helix axis
				#+ive for Right handed helix, -ive for left handed helix
		N0 = Number of turns major helix makes in axial distance p0(Pitch) = 1
		N1 = Number of turns minor helix makes in axial distance p0
		
		number of residues in axial distance p0 = p0/h
		Since 2*p=7; -> 7 residues in 2 rotation; 
		7*h axial distance -> 2 rotations or turns; 
		In p0 axial distance -> (p0/h)*(2/7) = N1 ; N0 = 1;
		
		7 residues -> 2 turns -> 2*2pi angle
		w1 = angle btw two residues -> 2pi*(2/7)
		
		Since:	-w1/w0 = N1/N0
		w0 = -w1*(N0/N1) = -2pi*h/p0
